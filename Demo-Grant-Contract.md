[*This is a non-binding demo contract only - it is not affiliated with the real solana foundation]

I. NOTICE AND DELIVERY OF GRANT OF TOKENS

The undersigned Recipient has been granted Tokens, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as follows:

Name: []

Address: []

Date of Grant: []

Total Number of Tokens Granted: []

II. AGREEMENT

1. Grant of Tokens. SOL* PBC hereby grants to Recipient the number of Tokens set forth in Section I above in exchange for Recipient’s services to SOL* PBC in accordance with the terms of the Statement of Work set forth in Exhibit A (the “SOW”), which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement. SOL* PBC will issue the tokens by means of a transfer to the Recipient’s digital wallet and the address of such digital wallet will be provided by the Recipient. Should the Recipient not provide SOL* PBC with a digital wallet address, SOL* PBC will be technologically unable to deliver the Tokens and such inability to deliver the Tokens will not be deemed non-performance of this Agreement.

2. Statements of Work. The SOW shall include a description of the work to be provided by each party, the party to provide such work, a description of deliverables, if any, to be produced by the party, any additional terms of payments of the Tokens, and such other terms and conditions as the parties may wish to include. Such terms and conditions will be more detailed and specific than what is included in this Agreement.

3. Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between any provision of a SOW and this Agreement, the SOW shall control, except as otherwise provided in the SOW.

4. Recipient’s Representations. Recipient shall, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement by Recipient, deliver to SOL* PBC the Investment Representation Statement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Recipient hereby makes the investment representations listed on Exhibit B to SOL* PBC as of the date of this Agreement and agrees that such representations are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference, such that SOL* PBC may rely on them in issuing the Tokens and for any other lawful purpose.

5. Compliance with Applicable Law. In the event that SOL* PBC makes the reasonable determination that for any reason delivery of the Tokens under this Agreement will violate or has violated any applicable law, SOL* PBC may terminate this Agreement, and the Recipient will not receive any Tokens under it. The Recipient may be required to return any Tokens that have been distributed to the Recipient previously under this Agreement, if SOL* PBC determines that the previous distribution was in violation of applicable law.

6. Tax Consequences. The Recipient has reviewed with the Recipient’s own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this grant and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Recipient is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of SOL* PBC or any of its agents. The Recipient understands that the Recipient (and not SOL* PBC) shall be responsible for any tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7. Acceptance of Agreement. The Recipient understands and agrees that this Token grant is made subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, the SOW). The Recipient acknowledges that crypto assets such as the Tokens are a new and relatively untested product. There is considerable uncertainty about their long-term viability, which could be affected by a variety of factors, including many market-based factors such economic growth, inflation, and others. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Tokens will hold their value or increase in value. The utility and value of the Tokens depends on SOL* PBC’s future success and support of SOL* PBC’s technology platform.

8. Successors. Any successor to SOL* PBC (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of SOL* PBC’s business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform the obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as SOL* PBC would be required to perform such obligations in the absence of a succession. For all purposes under this Agreement, the term “Company” shall include any successor to SOL* PBC’s business and/or assets that executes and delivers the assumption agreement described in this section or which becomes bound by the terms of this Agreement by operation of law. Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon the Recipient and his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

9. Assignment; Transfers. Except as set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement, and any and all rights, duties and obligations hereunder, shall not be assigned, transferred, delegated or sublicensed by the Recipient without the prior written consent of SOL* PBC. Any attempt by the Recipient without such consent to assign, transfer, delegate or sublicense any rights, duties or obligations that arise under this Agreement shall be void. Except as set forth in this Agreement, any transfers in violation of any restriction upon transfer contained in any section of this Agreement shall be void, unless such restriction is waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

10. Ownership of Deliverables and Work Product. SOL* PBC shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to any (i) deliverables provided to SOL* PBC under an SOW or (ii) work product, technology or inventions developed under an SOW, including all intellectual property rights therein and thereto.

11. Amendment; Waiver. Except as expressly provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument referencing this Agreement and signed by SOL* PBC and the Recipient. Either party’s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing any other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted both parties hereunder are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party’s right to assert any other legal remedy available to it.

12. Recipient Investment Representations and Further Documents. The Recipient agrees upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or reasonably desirable in the view of SOL* PBC to carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement, including (but not limited to) the applicable exhibits and attachments to this Agreement.

13. Severability. Should any provision of this Agreement be found to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall remain enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law.

14. Rights to Tokens. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including without limitation the SOW), the Recipient shall have all the rights of ownership of the Tokens from and after the date that the Recipient delivers a fully executed copy of this Agreement (including the applicable exhibits and attachments to this Agreement) to SOL* PBC, and until such time as the Recipient disposes of the Tokens in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the Tokens (as provided in the Offering Circular for the Tokens, available at [website address to be provided], and the Terms of Use for the SOL* Network sponsored by SOLINC*, Inc.), available at [website address to be provided]. Upon such transfer, the Recipient shall have no further rights as a holder of the Tokens.

15. Agreement to Terms of Use. Recipient agrees to the Terms of Use for the SOL* Network sponsored by SOLINC*, available at [website address to be provided] (the “Terms of Use”), and to be bound by the Terms of Use. Recipient agrees to provide the services set out in the SOW, to utilize the SOL* Network, and to use the Tokens only in ways that do not conflict with the Terms of Use. SOLINC* agrees to be bound by the Terms of Use.

16. Independent Contractor. In performing under this Agreement, each party is acting as independent contractor, and in no way are the parties to be construed as partners, employees, joint venturers, fiduciaries or agents of one another in any respect.

17. Limitations on Damages.

(a) IN NO EVENT SHALL SOL* PBC, SOLINC*, INC. AND ANY OTHER SOLINC* PARTIES (JOINTLY) BE LIABLE TO THE RECIPIENT FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING SHALL BE INTERPRETED AND HAVE EFFECT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RULE OR REGULATION.

(b) IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF SOL* PBC, SOLINC*, INC. AND ANY OTHER SOLINC* PARTIES (JOINTLY), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), OR OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS EXCEED THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TOKENS GRANTED TO THE RECIPIENT AS OF THE DATE OF SUCH GRANT.

18. Liability.

(a) The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Recipient shall be liable for all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including all expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any claim whatsoever) arising out of or based upon any inaccuracy in the representations provided by the Recipient in this Agreement, including those representations in the Investment Representation Statement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 18 or elsewhere in the Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of SOL* PBC, SOLINC*, Inc. and any other SOLINC* parties' compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the Recipient of any of its legal rights under applicable U.S. federal securities laws or any other laws whose applicability is not permitted to be contractually waived.


DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Foundation and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. **

(a) No Representative Actions. You and the Foundation agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this EULA or the Service is personal to you and the Foundation and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

(b) Arbitration of Disputes. You and the Foundation waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to this EULA and the Service, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against the Foundation you agree to first contact the Foundation and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to the Foundation by email at operations@solana.org or by certified mail addressed to Industriestrasse 47, 6300 Zug, Switzerland. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and the Foundation cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Zug, Switzerland. You and the Foundation agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

(c) You and the Foundation agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

(d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, the Foundation, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

(e) You and the Foundation agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and the Foundation will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by the Foundation, the Foundation will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and the Foundation agree that the Kanton of Zug shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. []{#h.lnxbz9 .anchor}

(f) Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and the Foundation will not have the right to assert the claim. []{#h.35nkun2 .anchor}

(g) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by mailing an opt-out notice to the Foundation at Industriestrasse 47, 6300 Zug, Switzerland. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the governing law and venue terms of this EULA.

(h) If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be enforceable.

GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE

Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Service will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Switzerland. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved in Zug, Switzerland.

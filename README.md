# Onchain-Grant-Agreements
Provides templates to apply Vellum on-chain agreements and signatures to the larger developer grants ecosystem.

Developer grants are a popular way to incentivise development of decentralised applications on various platforms. For maximum transparency and trust, it is preferable if such grants are signed and executed in public - as this provides accountability, and also allows the community to transparently observe the fair execution of the grants, and the disbursement process. Vellum provides effective infrastructure to bring these grant agreements fully on-chain, and also provides the capabilities to allow on-chain execution of contractual terms - for eg., when developers accomplish promised milestones.

Here we provide a template contract for issuing developer grants on Solana. This template can serve as an easy reference and Quickstart for all grants being issued in the Solana ecosystem and beyond, including grants from the Solana Foundation , and various other DAOs and crypto companies.

To demonstrate our example, we provide a simple example agreement for developing an open-source product in exchange for tokens  - the specific functionalities of such a product are excluded and left up to individual grant creators. We also include the dispute resolution clause, as found on the Solana Foundation website :  - as an example, this can be modified/replaced according to the needs of the grant provider.

Below we provide a breakdown of some key provisions in the agreement, with tips on how they may be modified depending on the use-case for that particular grant:
